# Day 3: 100 Days of CSS Projects

Welcome to Day 3 of the 100 Days of CSS Challenge. Today's project involves creating an animation that illustrates a sun moving over a pyramid, casting a shadow on the ground and changing the appearance of the pyramid's sides. This project is about exploring the capabilities of CSS animations and transitions.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three primary files:

- `index.html` for the HTML structure.
- `style.css` for styling the HTML elements.
- There is no JavaScript involved in today's project.

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure comprises a container div, within which there are divs representing the ground, pyramid, and sun.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file includes styles for each element and keyframes for the animations. The animations include:

- A disappearing/reappearing animation for the container to simulate day and night.
- A shadow animation that changes shape to simulate the moving sun.
- Side shift animations that change the color of the pyramid's sides to simulate light and shadow effects.
- A rotation animation for the sun to simulate its movement across the sky.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_3
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/day_3
open index.html
```
