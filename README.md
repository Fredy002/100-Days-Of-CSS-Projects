| [21](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_21-30/day_21) | Pacman Eating Animation: This HTML and CSS design features the iconic Pacman character. The design is set against a dark background, where a yellow Pacman opens and closes its mouth in a classic chomping motion, animated using the stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset properties. An eye element moves in sync with the mouth, creating a lively effect. In front of Pacman, there's a line of dots representing the pellets that Pacman eats in the game. These dots appear to be consumed as Pacman moves along, thanks to a cleverly animated stroke-dasharray. This design captures the essence of the classic arcade game with a minimalist and modern touch. | ![day_21](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/523cda09-0921-4d39-ac26-16ee1a8247e8) |
| [22](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_21-30/day_22) | Daily Progress Tracker: This webpage features a fitness tracking interface with a deep blue background and white text for contrast. It displays a large central circle that shows the number of calories burned, animated to indicate progress towards a goal. Two smaller circles display the number of steps taken and distance traveled in kilometers, both also animated to show progress. The text within these circles provides the numerical values and respective units, such as 'kcal', 'steps', and 'km'. Each circle has a background stroke and a colored progress stroke that fills up according to the data. The animations are smooth and signify an increase in values, simulating the tracking of daily fitness activity. | ![day_22](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/93c1abd5-c1fe-4c82-b14e-3106a0e7154b) |
| [23](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_21-30/day_23) | Inspirational quote visualization: The animation sequence includes the expansion and disappearance of the circle, the extension and retraction of the horizontal lines, and the drawing of the brackets from the center outward. The words "collect" and "not things" slide into view as part of the animation, enhancing the visual impact of the presentation. The entire design leverages CSS animations to dynamic effect, emphasizing the theme of valuing experiences over material possessions. | ![day_23](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/1b82efb7-48c9-412a-8a61-2ba02c939545) |
| [24](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_21-30/day_24) | Interactive Button with Check Animation: This HTML/CSS snippet features an interactive "finish" button that, when clicked, triggers a green checkmark to appear and a surrounding circle animation to expand and fade out, signaling task completion. The button's border color changes to match the background as the button itself transforms into a smaller circle, creating a smooth, satisfying visual effect for an action confirmation. | ![day_24] |
| [25](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_21-30/day_25) | Interactive Map Card Interface: This HTML/CSS/JavaScript snippet showcases an interactive card interface on a stylized map background. A clickable pin icon, with a floating animation, reveals a detailed card containing information about "Phil's Surfshop," including an image, address, and action links ('save' and 'route'). The card and pin icon animate smoothly between visible and hidden states, enhancing the user's interactive experience. The card is initially hidden and becomes visible when the pin is clicked, adding a dynamic and engaging element to the map interface. | ![day_25] |
