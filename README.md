| [31](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_31-40/day_31) | Dot Movement Animation: This HTML and CSS code snippet creates a dynamic visual display with twenty dots, each animated to move horizontally back and forth. The dots are styled with a circular shape and a white color, set against a deep purple background. Each dot is assigned an individual animation with slightly different timings and delays, resulting in a cascading effect where the dots move in a sequential, wave-like pattern. This creates an engaging and fluid motion, adding an element of visual interest and dynamism to the web page. | ![day_31](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/6dcbd15e-b1e0-4a72-ab73-b2e598cb295c) |
| [32](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_31-40/day_32) | Interactive Counter UI: This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates an interactive counter with a stylish gradient background. The counter has a "+" button to increase the count and a "-" button to decrease it, each with distinct hover effects. The number is displayed in the center, updating dynamically as the buttons are clicked. The plus and minus symbols are elegantly designed, changing colors on hover for better user interaction. This counter is a functional and visually appealing element for websites that require numerical input or adjustment. | ![day_32](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/f8c26780-e6ef-4b29-8741-9dac7491319b) |
| [33](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_31-40/day_33) | Animated Weather Scene: This HTML and CSS code creates an animated weather scene with a moving sun and clouds on a light blue background, simulating a clear day. The scene includes three differently sized clouds (large, medium, and small) and a sun, all styled with CSS and SVG paths. The sun and clouds move horizontally across the container, creating a dynamic visual effect. The sun is animated to move from left to right, while the clouds move in the opposite direction, adding to the realism of the scene. This design can be used for weather-related applications or websites to visually represent a sunny day. | ![day_33](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/f9f7b5cd-a1d4-475e-bf6d-76cb5a30d1cd) |
| [34](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_31-40/day_34) | Animated Text and Lines: This HTML and CSS code snippet creates an animated graphical display featuring stylized text and dynamic lines. Set against a vibrant pink background, the central element is a piece of SVG text, around which two horizontal lines extend. These lines and the text are animated to create a visually engaging effect. The lines dynamically expand from the center, and the SVG text fills in with a stroke animation, creating a sense of the text being drawn onto the screen. This kind of animation can be particularly effective for splash screens, introductions, or eye-catching headers on websites and digital presentations.| ![day_34](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/278163a4-5871-49b3-ac86-7ef55c75aafd) |
| [35](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_31-40/day_35) | Circular Loader Animation: This HTML and CSS code creates a simple yet elegant circular loader animation. The loader is centered within a square container, which has a soothing teal background. The animation consists of two concentric circles: a static background circle and an animated foreground circle. The background circle is styled with a darker teal stroke, while the animated loader circle is in white. The loader circle features a "dash" effect, making it appear as a rotating line around the circle's circumference. This rotation is achieved through a combination of linear animations that manipulate the stroke-dashoffset and rotate the circle, creating a smooth, continuous spinning effect. This type of loader is commonly used to indicate loading or processing states in web applications and interfaces. | ![day_35](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/922c9541-c06d-439a-bc75-ceccd5214650) |
