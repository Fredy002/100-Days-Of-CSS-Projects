| [31](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_31-40/day_31) | Dot Movement Animation: This HTML and CSS code snippet creates a dynamic visual display with twenty dots, each animated to move horizontally back and forth. The dots are styled with a circular shape and a white color, set against a deep purple background. Each dot is assigned an individual animation with slightly different timings and delays, resulting in a cascading effect where the dots move in a sequential, wave-like pattern. This creates an engaging and fluid motion, adding an element of visual interest and dynamism to the web page. | ![day_31](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/6dcbd15e-b1e0-4a72-ab73-b2e598cb295c) |
| [32](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_31-40/day_32) | Interactive Counter UI: This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates an interactive counter with a stylish gradient background. The counter has a "+" button to increase the count and a "-" button to decrease it, each with distinct hover effects. The number is displayed in the center, updating dynamically as the buttons are clicked. The plus and minus symbols are elegantly designed, changing colors on hover for better user interaction. This counter is a functional and visually appealing element for websites that require numerical input or adjustment. | ![day_32](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/f8c26780-e6ef-4b29-8741-9dac7491319b) |
| [33](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_31-40/day_33) | Animated Weather Scene: This HTML and CSS code creates an animated weather scene with a moving sun and clouds on a light blue background, simulating a clear day. The scene includes three differently sized clouds (large, medium, and small) and a sun, all styled with CSS and SVG paths. The sun and clouds move horizontally across the container, creating a dynamic visual effect. The sun is animated to move from left to right, while the clouds move in the opposite direction, adding to the realism of the scene. This design can be used for weather-related applications or websites to visually represent a sunny day. | ![day_33](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/f9f7b5cd-a1d4-475e-bf6d-76cb5a30d1cd) |
