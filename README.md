The text within these circles provides the numerical values and respective units, such as 'kcal', 'steps', and 'km'.

Similarly, interacting with the second and third cards cycles through them in a loop. Each card features a unique number and background color, along with a headline and supportive text. The smooth animations and clear, simple design make for an engaging user experience. | ![day_26](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/234d6f99-c7af-43d6-a1bd-b0b3417fc686) |
