| [11](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_11) | Animated Walking Legs: This design simulates a walking scene with a pair of legs swinging and shoes moving in a rhythmic pattern against a moving ground, creating a walking illusion. The ground animation, with a conic-gradient pattern, gives a sense of motion, enhancing the walking effect. The simplistic color palette and detailed shoe image contribute to the visual appeal. The repetitive walking motion is achieved through well-coordinated animations, offering a playful and engaging visual experience. | ![day_11](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/ea8ff44b-a52e-49b8-a1fd-dcef52c01353) |
| [12](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_12) | Interactive Quote Display: This design shows an Einstein quote with a focus on the word "obsession" that triggers a tooltip on hover. The tooltip provides pronunciation and definition. Aesthetics include a soothing color palette and playful typography. The large quotation mark adds a creative touch. The tooltip animation is smooth, enhancing user interaction and experience. | ![day_12](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/304ce1e1-bd77-456c-94e9-10985dd60339) |
| [13](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_13) | Interactive Profile Cards: This layout comprises four clickable profile cards. Each card reveals a detailed profile view on click, which includes a name, image, and action buttons for phone, message, and heart icon. The transition animations between the compact and expanded views are smooth and engaging. A "close" button on the detailed view allows user to retract the expanded profile view. The color palette and design elements provide a clean and modern aesthetic. | ![day_13](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/a6fd5a78-f9c8-4229-9ee8-9a899830679c) |
| [14](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_14) | Animated Transportation Card: This creative design features a double-sided card with a bicycle scene on the front and a helicopter scene on the back. The front shows a bicycle on a road with moving road stripes, simulating motion. On flip, the card reveals a helicopter in the sky with clouds drifting by. The transition between the two sides is smooth and visually pleasing, achieved by a 3D flip effect. The lively animations and the contrasting ground and sky scenes make this card engaging and playful. | ![day_14](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/67cbf89f-55c4-4779-9f8e-9b5bca3bb784) |
| [15](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_15) | File Upload Interface: This interface provides a clean and straightforward design for uploading files. The central element is a white box with a dashed border, indicating where users can drop files. Above this box, there's a title saying "Drop file to upload", and below it, a button labeled "Upload file". The background gradient from teal to green adds a touch of color, making the interface more vibrant. Overall, the design is user-friendly, guiding users intuitively through the file upload process. | ![day_15](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/cef2654d-7287-4b0c-9765-89442671cf69) |
| [16](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_16) | Geometric Animation: This design features a dynamic display of geometric shapes, including a circle, octagon, and triangle, each animated to transform and scale in a rhythmic pattern. The circle pulsates with a surrounding ring, the octagon appears and disappears with sparkling effects, and the triangle grows and shrinks with its own set of sparkles. These animations are set against a serene blue background, creating a mesmerizing and abstract visual experience. | ![day_16](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/ce6c5af9-d4fa-4439-9044-7a4f1fc7758b) |
| [17](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_17) | Polygonal Art: This interactive design showcases a central polygonal art piece composed of three layered polygons in varying shades of gray. The background features a series of diagonal lines that add depth and perspective to the composition. Upon hovering over the polygons, their colors interchange, offering a dynamic visual effect. This engaging piece is encapsulated within a square container with a subtle shadow, enhancing the overall three-dimensional appearance. |![day_17](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/69374e18-827b-4c3a-ac44-fcd4b48aef23) |
