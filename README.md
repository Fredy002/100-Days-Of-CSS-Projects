# Day 1: 100 Days of CSS Projects

Welcome to Day 1 of the 100 Days of CSS Challenge. Today, we kickstart this journey with a simple yet engaging CSS project that displays a stylized representation of the number "100" alongside the text "DAYS CSS CHALLENGE". The main goal of this project is to utilize basic CSS properties and create a visually pleasing design.

## Project Structure

This project consists of a single HTML file `index.html` and a CSS file `style.css`. The `index.html` file contains the basic structure of the design, while the `style.css` file styles the HTML elements to achieve the desired look.

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure consists of a container div which houses two main divs - one for rendering the number "100" and the other for displaying the text "DAYS CSS CHALLENGE".

### CSS Styling

The CSS file defines some root variables for colors, which are used throughout the rest of the styles. Basic reset styles are applied to ensure consistent rendering across different browsers. The design uses Flexbox to align items centrally on the page, and CSS shapes, shadows, and gradients to create a visually appealing representation of the number "100".

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects.git
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects
open index.html
```
