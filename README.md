| [21](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_21-30/day_21) | Pacman Eating Animation: This HTML and CSS design features the iconic Pacman character. The design is set against a dark background, where a yellow Pacman opens and closes its mouth in a classic chomping motion, animated using the stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset properties. An eye element moves in sync with the mouth, creating a lively effect. In front of Pacman, there's a line of dots representing the pellets that Pacman eats in the game. These dots appear to be consumed as Pacman moves along, thanks to a cleverly animated stroke-dasharray. This design captures the essence of the classic arcade game with a minimalist and modern touch. | ![day_21] |
