| [41](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_41-50/day_41) | Error Alert Interface: The code forms a web-based error alert interface. It features a centrally placed alert box within a dark-themed container. The alert box, with a white background and rounded corners, includes an error icon, a bold title "Oh snap!", and a descriptive error message. The "Dismiss" button at the bottom, styled in red, changes color slightly on hover, enhancing user interaction. The alert box employs animation for appearing and disappearing, creating a dynamic user experience. The JavaScript toggles the 'hide' class on the alert box upon clicking the button, triggering the dismissal animation. This design is useful for displaying error messages in web applications in an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly manner. | ![day_41](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/672d35c5-2ac2-4612-982b-abeb831dcd61) |
| [42](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_41-50/day_42) |Starry Sky Animation: A circular sky gradient, transitioning from dark to light blue, forms the backdrop. Twenty white stars of uniform size are scattered across the sky, each flickering at different intervals due to the flicker animation, creating a twinkling effect. Four shooting stars, represented as horizontal lines, traverse the sky diagonally at varying speeds and starting points, enabled by the shotting-star animation. This scene captures the essence of a night sky, offering a dynamic and visually engaging representation of stars and shooting stars in motion. | ![day_42](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/8917d6f4-dda6-48cb-987b-386aaca934ab) |
