| [11](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_11) | Animated Walking Legs: This design simulates a walking scene with a pair of legs swinging and shoes moving in a rhythmic pattern against a moving ground, creating a walking illusion. The ground animation, with a conic-gradient pattern, gives a sense of motion, enhancing the walking effect. The simplistic color palette and detailed shoe image contribute to the visual appeal. The repetitive walking motion is achieved through well-coordinated animations, offering a playful and engaging visual experience. | ![day_11](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/ea8ff44b-a52e-49b8-a1fd-dcef52c01353) |
| [12](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_12) | Interactive Quote Display: This design shows an Einstein quote with a focus on the word "obsession" that triggers a tooltip on hover. The tooltip provides pronunciation and definition. Aesthetics include a soothing color palette and playful typography. The large quotation mark adds a creative touch. The tooltip animation is smooth, enhancing user interaction and experience. | ![day_12](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/304ce1e1-bd77-456c-94e9-10985dd60339) |
| [13](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_13) | Interactive Profile Cards: This layout comprises four clickable profile cards. Each card reveals a detailed profile view on click, which includes a name, image, and action buttons for phone, message, and heart icon. The transition animations between the compact and expanded views are smooth and engaging. A "close" button on the detailed view allows user to retract the expanded profile view. The color palette and design elements provide a clean and modern aesthetic. | ![day_13](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/a6fd5a78-f9c8-4229-9ee8-9a899830679c) |
| [14](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_14) | Animated Transportation Card: This creative design features a double-sided card with a bicycle scene on the front and a helicopter scene on the back. The front shows a bicycle on a road with moving road stripes, simulating motion. On flip, the card reveals a helicopter in the sky with clouds drifting by. The transition between the two sides is smooth and visually pleasing, achieved by a 3D flip effect. The lively animations and the contrasting ground and sky scenes make this card engaging and playful. | ![day_14](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/67cbf89f-55c4-4779-9f8e-9b5bca3bb784) |
| [15](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_15) | File Upload Interface: This interface provides a clean and straightforward design for uploading files. The central element is a white box with a dashed border, indicating where users can drop files. Above this box, there's a title saying "Drop file to upload", and below it, a button labeled "Upload file". The background gradient from teal to green adds a touch of color, making the interface more vibrant. Overall, the design is user-friendly, guiding users intuitively through the file upload process. | ![day_15](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/cef2654d-7287-4b0c-9765-89442671cf69) |
| [16](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_16) | Geometric Animation: This design features a dynamic display of geometric shapes, including a circle, octagon, and triangle, each animated to transform and scale in a rhythmic pattern. The circle pulsates with a surrounding ring, the octagon appears and disappears with sparkling effects, and the triangle grows and shrinks with its own set of sparkles. These animations are set against a serene blue background, creating a mesmerizing and abstract visual experience. | ![day_16](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/ce6c5af9-d4fa-4439-9044-7a4f1fc7758b) |
| [17](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_17) | Polygonal Art: This interactive design showcases a central polygonal art piece composed of three layered polygons in varying shades of gray. The background features a series of diagonal lines that add depth and perspective to the composition. Upon hovering over the polygons, their colors interchange, offering a dynamic visual effect. This engaging piece is encapsulated within a square container with a subtle shadow, enhancing the overall three-dimensional appearance. |![day_17](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/69374e18-827b-4c3a-ac44-fcd4b48aef23) |
| [18](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_18) | Elastic Ellipse: This animated design features a central ellipse that performs an elastic rotation, exhibiting a mesmerizing, rhythmic dance between its two halvesâ€”one grey and the other green. The ellipse is set against a split background with the top half in grey and the bottom in green, mirroring the colors of the ellipse. The continuous, fluid animation of the ellipse creates a captivating optical illusion, drawing the viewer's attention to the center of the composition. The entire scene is neatly framed within a square container with rounded corners, adding a touch of elegance to the dynamic visual experience. | ![day_18](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/94a7aa20-66a2-43d5-a31e-54a36586b35e) |
| [19](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_19) | Interactive Image Carousel: This design features a simple yet elegant image carousel with three selection indicators. The user can click on the circular indicators to navigate through the images. When an indicator is selected, it highlights with a filled circle, providing a visual cue of the current selection. The images seamlessly slide across the container as the selection changes, facilitated by radio buttons that trigger the transition effect. The carousel is housed within a square container with rounded corners, creating a clean and modern look. This interactive design offers a user-friendly way to browse through multiple images in a confined space. | ![day_19](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/5046b5ed-bb15-4479-b9c9-3b3aa2a5c326) |
| [20](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_20) | Interactive Send Mail Animation: This HTML and CSS design features an engaging "Send Mail" animation. When the user clicks the "Send Mail" button, it triggers a series of animations. The button morphs into an airplane icon, symbolizing the sending of an email, which then appears to take flight off the screen. Simultaneously, two circles and the mail icon animate to complement the sending action. There's also a "reset" button that fades in, allowing users to reset the animation and send another email. This design is visually appealing and provides a delightful user interaction, enhancing the experience of a simple action like sending an email. | ![day_20](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/affe21d1-c8e2-49ce-b85d-058103822367) |
