| [11](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_11) | Animated Walking Legs: This design simulates a walking scene with a pair of legs swinging and shoes moving in a rhythmic pattern against a moving ground, creating a walking illusion. The ground animation, with a conic-gradient pattern, gives a sense of motion, enhancing the walking effect. The simplistic color palette and detailed shoe image contribute to the visual appeal. The repetitive walking motion is achieved through well-coordinated animations, offering a playful and engaging visual experience. | ![day_11]() |
