# Day 2: 100 Days of CSS Projects

Welcome to Day 2 of the 100 Days of CSS Challenge. Today's project is a classic animated hamburger menu icon, which transitions into a close icon (X) upon clicking and reverts back to the hamburger icon upon a subsequent click. This project is about understanding and implementing basic animations and transitions using CSS and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three primary files: 

- `index.html` for the HTML structure.
- `style.css` for styling the HTML elements.
- `script.js` for adding interactivity to the hamburger icon.

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure is straightforward with a single div element representing the menu icon. This div contains three span elements which represent the lines of the hamburger icon.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file contains styles for the hamburger icon and the animations necessary for transitioning the icon to a close icon (X) and back. Each span element is styled to look like a line of the hamburger icon, and animations are defined to handle the transition between the two states of the icon.

### JavaScript Interactivity

The `script.js` file contains simple JavaScript to toggle classes on the span elements to trigger the CSS animations when the hamburger icon is clicked.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_2
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/day_2
open index.html
```
