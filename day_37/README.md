## Overview

- The project features three cards that rotate in a 3D space, creating an engaging switch animation.
- This design can be utilized in web interfaces where showcasing multiple items in a small space is required.
- The animation is purely CSS-driven, showcasing the power of CSS animations and 3D transformations.

## HTML Structure

- The `.container` class holds the overall structure.
- Inside, the `.center` class creates a 3D space for the cards.
- Each card is defined with a `.card` class and additional classes for individual styling.

## CSS Details

- The `.container` and `.center` classes define the layout and perspective for the 3D effect.
- The `.card` class sets the basic style for each card, including dimensions, background, and shadow.
- The `.top` and `.content` classes style the top bar and content area of each card.

## Animation Mechanics

- Keyframes (`switch-one`, `switch-two`, `switch-three`) define the 3D movement of each card.
- CSS `transform` and `box-shadow` properties are used to create the depth and movement effect.
- The animations are synchronized to create a continuous and smooth card switching effect.

## How to Use

1. Incorporate the provided HTML and CSS into your project.
2. Customize the content and style of each card to fit your needs.
3. Use this animation for feature lists, product showcases, or interactive displays.
