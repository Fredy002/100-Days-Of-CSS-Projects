## Overview

- The counter allows users to increment and decrement a numerical value.
- It features a modern, sleek design with a gradient background.
- The project is an excellent example of combining basic JavaScript with CSS for interactive web elements.

## HTML Structure

- The `container` div is the main wrapper for the counter.
- Inside the container, there's a `counter` div that holds the minus (`minus`), number display (`number`), and plus (`plus`) sections.

## CSS Details

- The `.container` class defines the size, background gradient, and styling of the counter's outer box.
- The `.counter` class specifies the layout and style of the counter interface.
- The `.minus` and `.plus` classes are styled to look like buttons, with hover effects for better user interaction.
- The `.number` class is used to display the current count in a centralized manner.

## JavaScript Functionality

- The script uses query selectors to target the number display and buttons.
- Event listeners are added to the plus and minus buttons to increment and decrement the count.
- The count is updated in real-time as the user interacts with the buttons.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on the plus (`+`) button to increase the count.
3. Click on the minus (`-`) button to decrease the count.
4. The counter will not decrement below zero.
