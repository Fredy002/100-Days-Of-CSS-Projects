# Day 19: Interactive Image Slider

Day 19 features an interactive image slider that allows users to switch between images using radio buttons, showcasing the use of CSS for creating dynamic user interfaces.

## Project Structure

This project is composed of:

- `index.html` - Holds the HTML structure.
- `style.css` - Contains the styling and layout.

### HTML Structure

The HTML document includes:

- A `container` div that encapsulates the entire slider.
- Inside the container, there are radio inputs for each image and corresponding labels styled as circles.
- A `bg` div that contains the images displayed in the slider.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file provides:

- Reset rules and centering for the body.
- Styling for the container and the `center` div.
- Custom styles for the radio inputs and labels, making the labels appear as clickable circles.
- An `.active` class that highlights the selected image.
- CSS transitions for smooth image sliding.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Launch the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the image slider in action.
