## Overview

- This project features a button with a unique border animation on hover.
- Ideal for modern websites looking for interactive UI elements.

## HTML Structure

- The main container `.container` holds the button element.
- Inside the button, there's a `<span>` for the button text and an SVG element for the border.

## CSS Details

- The `.container` class defines the layout, dimensions, and styles of the container.
- `.button` class styles the button, including positioning and grid display.
- The SVG border is styled using `.border`, `.bg-line`, and `.hl-line` classes.

## Animation and Interaction

- CSS transitions are used for animating the SVG border.
- The `.hl-line` class has a stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset to create the moving border effect.
- Hovering over the button triggers the animation, changing the border and background color.

## Integration Instructions

1. Insert the HTML structure into your page.
2. Link the provided CSS for styling and animation.
3. Adjust the button text, color, and size as needed for your design.
