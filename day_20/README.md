## Project Structure

The project consists of:

- `index.html` - Contains the HTML structure.
- `style.css` - Provides the styling and animations.

### HTML Structure

The HTML file includes:

- A `container` div that wraps the entire button and animation elements.
- An input of type checkbox (`#cb`) that controls the state of the animation.
- Labels for the checkbox styled as buttons.
- SVG elements representing a mail icon and a plane icon.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file contains:

- Basic reset rules and centering styles for the body.
- Styling for the `container` and its child elements.
- Custom animations for the button, mail icon, plane icon, and the circles.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to interact with the animated button.



```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_20
