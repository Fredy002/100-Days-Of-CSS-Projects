# Day 15: 100 Days of CSS Projects

Day 15 introduces a user-friendly file upload interface. This project combines HTML and CSS to create an intuitive and visually appealing drag-and-drop file upload component.

## Project Structure

The project is composed of two main files:

- `index.html` - the HTML structure.
- `style.css` - for styling.

### HTML Structure

The HTML contains a `container` div that wraps around a `file` div. The `file` div includes several child divs such as `title`, `bar`, `square`, and `uploadBtn`. The `square` div further contains an image representing the upload icon and an input element of type file.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file outlines the styles for the various elements, with key points including:

- Defining the layout and visual styling of the file upload component.
- Utilizing a linear gradient for the container background.
- Styling the file upload area with dashed borders and hover effects.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_15
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects

```
