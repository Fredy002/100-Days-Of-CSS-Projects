# Day 4: 100 Days of CSS Projects

Welcome to Day 4 of the 100 Days of CSS Challenge. Today's project demonstrates a cascading animation of spheres within spheres. The spheres scale up and down in a rhythmic fashion creating a visually pleasing effect.

## Project Structure

This project consists of three primary files:

- `index.html` for the HTML structure.
- `style.css` for styling and animations.
- There is no JavaScript involved in today's project.

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure comprises a container div, which houses three nested divs representing the spheres.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file includes styles for each element and keyframes for the animations. The animations include scaling up and scaling down of the spheres at different intervals.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_4
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/day_4
open index.html
```

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding and implementing CSS animations and keyframes.
- Exploring the animation property and its sub-properties like animation-duration, animation-timing-function, etc.
- Experimenting with scale transformation to create the scaling effect.
- Understanding the concept of nested animations and their visual impact.
