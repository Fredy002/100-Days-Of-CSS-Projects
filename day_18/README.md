# Day 18: Elastic Ellipse Animation

Day 18 showcases an elastic ellipse animation that smoothly transitions between two colors, demonstrating a creative use of CSS3 animations and transforms.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

- `index.html` - contains the HTML structure.
- `style.css` - for the styling and animations.

### HTML Structure

The HTML file includes a `container` div, which houses two divs representing the top and bottom halves of the ellipse (`top` and `bottom`) and an `ellipse` div containing two colored divs (`grey` and `green`).

### CSS Styling

The CSS file contains:

- Basic reset rules and centering for the body.
- Styling for the container and its child divs.
- Styling for the ellipse and its colored halves.
- Keyframe animations for the elastic effect.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the animation.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_18
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects
open index.html
```

## Learning Outcomes

- Implementing keyframe animations for smooth transitions.
- Using preserve-3d and backface-visibility to create depth in 2D elements.
- Understanding the use of rotateX for flipping elements.

Feel free to explore the code to understand how the styling is achieved and maybe tweak some values to see how the design changes. Happy coding!
