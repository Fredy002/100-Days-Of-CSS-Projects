## Project Structure

This project consists of three primary files:

- `index.html` for the HTML structure.
- `style.css` for styling.
- There is no JavaScript involved in today's project.

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure is composed of a main container div which houses several other divs and SVG elements to create a graphical representation of a weekly revenue report. The report includes details such as the date, type of report, the revenue value, and graphical data representing Views and Purchases over the week.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file contains styles for positioning, coloring, and styling various elements on the page. It also includes the import of a Google Font 'Open Sans'. The graphical data representation is achieved using SVG elements and the `polyline` tag to create the line graphs.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_5
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/day_5
open index.html
```


## Learning Outcomes
- Utilizing SVG elements and the polyline tag to create graphical data representations.
- Working with CSS to style and position elements.
- Creating tooltips and data points on the graph.
- Implementing CSS transitions for smooth hover effects.
