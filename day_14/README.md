# Day 13: 100 Days of CSS Projects

On Day 13, we explore a stylish profile card design featuring neat animations. The project is set up to showcase a grid of profiles that unveil detailed information upon interaction.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into three main files:

- `index.html` - the HTML structure.
- `style.css` - for styling.
- `script.js` - for interactivity.

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure comprises a main `container` div that encapsulates individual `profile` divs. Each `profile` div contains an image, overlay, and a plus icon. Additionally, there's a `detail` div to display more information about a profile when selected.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file defines the styles for the various elements, some of which include:

- Setting up a grid for profile cards.
- Styling the overlay and plus icon to appear upon hovering over a profile.
- Designing a detailed profile view with transitions for smooth animations.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is utilized to toggle the visibility of the detailed view whenever a profile or close button is clicked.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_14
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects
open index.html
```
