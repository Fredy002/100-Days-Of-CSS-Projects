## Overview

- The project features a night sky with twinkling stars and shooting stars, creating a serene and animated backdrop.
- It's an excellent addition for websites needing a touch of nature-inspired beauty.

## HTML Structure

- The main container `.container` houses the entire night sky setup.
- Inside, the `.sky` div serves as the background for the stars.
- Multiple `.star` elements are positioned absolutely to mimic the appearance of stars in the sky.
- `.shotting-star` elements represent shooting stars, adding dynamic motion to the scene.

## CSS Details

- The `.container` class sets the dimensions and the general layout.
- `.sky` is styled with a gradient to simulate the night sky.
- Each `.star` is styled and animated individually to create a twinkling effect.
- The `.shotting-star` classes are animated to move across the sky, creating the effect of shooting stars.

## Animation and Keyframes

- The `flicker` animation makes the stars twinkle by varying their opacity.
- The `shotting-star` animation moves the shooting stars across the sky, enhancing the overall celestial experience.

## How to Integrate

1. Add the provided HTML structure to your web page.
2. Link the CSS for the starry sky's styling.
3. Customize the positioning and number of stars and shooting stars as desired.
