# Day 23: Collect Moments Animation

Day 23 presents a compelling animation themed "Collect Moments, Not Things", featuring a combination of geometric shapes and animated text.

## Project Structure

This project is composed of:

- `index.html` - The markup for the animation, including div elements for the circle, lines, brackets, and text.
- `style.css` - Styles and keyframe animations that bring the elements to life.

### HTML Elements

The HTML includes a `container` div that encapsulates:

- A `circle` for the central graphic element.
- `line` elements representing the horizontal lines.
- `bracket` elements for the brackets around the word 'moments'.
- Textual elements `small` and `big` for the phrase of the day.

### CSS Styling and Animation

The CSS file sets:

- The initial styles for body and container.
- Positions and z-index for the animated elements.
- The `@keyframes` animations that scale, transform, and reveal the elements in a choreographed sequence.

## How to Use

To see the animation:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_21-30/day_23
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects
open index.html
```

## Learning Outcomes

- Implementing complex animations with multiple elements.
- Using @keyframes to create a sequence of animations.
- Managing z-index and positioning to create depth and order in animations.
