# Day 44: Rotating Rectangles

Day 44 of the 100 Days of CSS Challenge features an intriguing animation of rotating rectangles, offering a visually engaging experience.

## Overview

- This project showcases a series of rectangles that rotate around a central point, creating a mesmerizing effect.
- Ideal for websites that require a dynamic, visually stimulating background or section.

## HTML Structure

- A main container `.container` holds all the rectangles.
- Individual `div` elements with class `.rect` represent each rectangle.
- There are twenty rectangles, each with a unique class from `.rect-one` to `.rect-twenty`.

## CSS Details

- The `.container` class sets the layout and dimensions.
- Each `.rect` is styled with a specific size and rotation animation.
- Z-index and aspect-ratio properties are used to layer and proportion the rectangles.

## Animation and Interaction

- CSS keyframes `rotate` are used to animate each rectangle with a smooth rotation.
- Rectangles have varying speeds and delays to create a complex rotating pattern.
- Hovering over the container pauses the animation, adding an interactive element.

## Integration Instructions

1. Add the HTML structure to your page.
2. Link the CSS for styling and animating the rectangles.
3. Customize the size, color, and speed of the rectangles as needed.

## Cloning the Project
