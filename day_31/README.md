## Overview

This project demonstrates:

- A grid of twenty dots arranged vertically.
- Each dot executing a horizontal movement animation with varying timings.
- Use of CSS animations to create a visually appealing, rhythmic pattern.

## HTML Structure

- A `container` div that serves as the main stage for the animation.
- Inside the container, a `dots` div contains twenty individual `dot` divs, each representing a moving dot.

## CSS Details

- The `.container` class defines the size, background color, and styling of the main stage.
- The `.dots` class provides positioning for the group of dots.
- Each `.dot` class specifies the size and style for individual dots.
- Unique classes like `.dot-one`, `.dot-two`, etc., are used to apply different animations to each dot.

## Animations

- The `@keyframes dot` animation defines a horizontal movement for each dot.
- Individual dots have varying animation durations and delay times, creating a wave-like effect.

## Usage Instructions

To view the animation:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Watch as the dots move back and forth in a coordinated manner.

## Cloning the Project

You can clone and run the project using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_31-40/day_31
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects

```

## Learning Outcomes

-  Adjust the color and size of the dots for different visual effects.
- Experiment with different animation curves and durations.
- Try arranging the dots in different patterns or shapes.
