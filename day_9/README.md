# Day 9: 100 Days of CSS Projects

Welcome to Day 9 of the 100 Days of CSS Challenge! Today's project features a creative illustration of a rainy scene with a moon and hills in the backdrop. The weather information is displayed in a card style overlay.

## Project Structure

This project comprises two main files:

- `index.html` for the HTML structure.
- `style.css` for styling.

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure is encapsulated within a main container div. Within the container, there are various div elements representing different parts of the scene like the moon, craters, hills, and raindrops. Additionally, there is a div for displaying weather information.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file contains styles for positioning, coloring, and animating the different elements in the scene. Some key highlights include:

- Utilizing `position: absolute` to precisely position elements.
- Employing `border-radius` to create circular shapes for moon, craters, and raindrops.
- Defining `@keyframes` for the animations like moon rise and raindrops falling.
- Varying opacity to create a realistic rain effect.
- Using z-index to layer the elements correctly.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_9
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/day_9
open index.html
````

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding the use of CSS positioning properties to create complex scenes.
- Implementing CSS transform and transition properties for creating animations.
- Layering elements using z-index property.
- Experimenting with opacity and box-shadow for visual effects
