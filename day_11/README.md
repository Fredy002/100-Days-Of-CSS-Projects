# Day 11: 100 Days of CSS Projects

Welcome to Day 11 of the 100 Days of CSS Challenge! Today's project features an animated pair of legs walking. This simple animation showcases the power of keyframes and CSS animations to create a playful and engaging user experience.

## Project Structure

This project comprises two main files:

- `index.html` for the HTML structure.
- `style.css` for styling.

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure is relatively straightforward. It comprises a main `container` div that encapsulates two `leg` divs, each with a `shoe` div nested within. The `container` div also contains a `ground` div representing the road.

### CSS Styling

The CSS styling creates the illusion of a pair of legs walking on a road by animating the `leg` and `shoe` divs. Here are some highlights:

- Utilizing `position: absolute` and `position: relative` to precisely position elements.
- Creating a road pattern with `conic-gradient()` for the ground.
- Defining `@keyframes` for `legSwing` and `shoeTurn` to create the walking animation.
- Applying the `animation` property to the `leg` and `shoe` divs to control the animation timing, easing, and iteration.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/day_11
open index.html


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_11
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects
open index.html
```
## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding the use of CSS position property to control the layout.
- Exploring the power of CSS @keyframes and animation property to create animations.
- Utilizing conic-gradient() to create a patterned background.
- Experimenting with transform and transform-origin to control the animation's movement.
