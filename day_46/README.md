# Day 46: Animated Dotted Rings

Day 46 of the 100 Days of CSS Challenge features an engaging display of animated dotted rings, creating a mesmerizing visual effect.

## Overview

- This creation showcases six rings, each composed of twelve dots, animated to rotate and change size, offering a dynamic visual experience.
- It's ideal for websites looking to add captivating, motion-based design elements.

## HTML Structure

- The core component is the `.container` which holds all the rings.
- Each `.ring` contains twelve `.dot` elements, forming the circular pattern.

## CSS Details

- The `.container` class defines the container's dimensions and styling.
- The `.ring` and `.dot` classes are used to style the rings and dots, including their positions and sizes.
- Opacity variations among the rings add depth to the animation.

## Animation and Interaction

- The animation is driven by CSS keyframes, affecting both the rotation and scaling of the rings.
- Each ring has a unique animation sequence, creating a cohesive yet varied movement pattern.

## Implementation Guide

1. Integrate the HTML structure into your webpage.
2. Apply the CSS to style the rings and dots, and to activate the animations.
3. Adjust the size, color, and speed of the animations as needed.
