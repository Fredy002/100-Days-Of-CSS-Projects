# Day 7: 100 Days of CSS Projects

Welcome to Day 7 of the 100 Days of CSS Challenge! Today's project is about creating a simplistic Notification and Menu UI using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript for interactivity.

![day_7](https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/assets/104151778/e9bfa1fb-207a-4434-95da-9bee1dcfd034) 

## Project Structure

This project primarily consists of three files:

- `index.html` for the HTML structure.
- `style.css` for styling.
- `script.js` for the JavaScript logic.

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure is organized within a main container div that houses two main sections: the Notification section and the Menu section. The Notification section contains a header with a menu icon, title, and search functionality. Below the header, there are individual notification items. The Menu section is a list of menu items with icons and text.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file contains styles for positioning, coloring, and styling various elements on the page. Some of the key features include:

- A grid and flexbox for layout control.
- CSS transitions for smooth animations.
- Custom hover effects for interactive elements.
- Styling of the notification line and circles.
- Usage of external Google font icons for menu icons.

### JavaScript Logic

The `script.js` file contains simple logic for toggling classes on certain elements to trigger transitions and displaying the search input field when the search icon is clicked.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_7
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/day_7
open index.html
