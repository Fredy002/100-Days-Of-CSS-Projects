# Day 17: Dynamic Lines and Interactive Polygon

Day 17 brings a creative geometric design that includes dynamically created lines using JavaScript and an interactive polygon with CSS hover effects.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main files:

- `index.html` - contains the HTML structure.
- `style.css` - for the styling.
- `script.js` - JavaScript file for dynamic line creation.

### HTML Structure

The HTML file is composed of a `container` div that includes a `lines` div where the dynamic lines are appended, and a `center` div housing an SVG `polygon`.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file contains:

- Styling for the container, lines, and center div.
- Styling for the SVG polygon and its parts (`light`, `middle`, `dark`).
- Hover effects for the polygon parts, changing their fill colors.

### JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript file contains a `createLines` function that dynamically appends line divs to the `linesContainer`.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_17
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects
open index.html
```

## Learning Outcomes

Feel free to explore the code to understand how the styling is achieved and maybe tweak some values to see how the design changes. Happy coding!
