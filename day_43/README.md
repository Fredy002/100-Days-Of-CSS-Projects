## Overview

- This project features a light bulb that changes color on hover, simulating a 'turning off' effect.
- Ideal for interactive web pages where user engagement is key, such as educational sites, kids' websites, or creative portfolios.

## HTML Structure

- The main container `.container` encapsulates the light bulb and its components.
- An SVG element with the id `#bulb` represents the light bulb.
- Another SVG element, `#base`, forms the base of the bulb.
- The div `#glow` creates the glowing effect around the bulb.

## CSS Details

- The `.container` class sets up the layout and dimensions of the light bulb.
- The `#bulb` SVG is styled to look like a bulb and changes color on hover.
- `#glow` is styled to create a glow effect, which disappears on hover.
- `#base` is styled to represent the bulb's base.

## Animation and Interaction

- Hovering over the bulb changes its color to simulate it turning off.
- The glow around the bulb disappears on hover, enhancing the effect.

## Integration Instructions

1. Add the provided HTML structure to your page.
2. Link the CSS for styling the light bulb.
3. Adjust the positioning, size, and colors as needed to fit your design.
