# Day 8: 100 Days of CSS Projects

Welcome to Day 8 of the 100 Days of CSS Challenge! Today's project focuses on creating an animated abstract geometric design using HTML and CSS. This piece consists of rotating circles in different sizes and blur effects to create a mesmerizing visual.

## Project Structure

This project primarily consists of two files:

- `index.html` for the HTML structure.
- `style.css` for styling.

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure is organized within a main container div called `.container`, which houses a div called `.center`. Inside the `.center` div, there are two groups of div elements representing internal and external circles.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file contains styles for positioning, coloring, and animating various elements on the page. Some of the key features include:

- Utilizing absolute and relative positioning to place elements precisely.
- Using `filter` property for blur and contrast effects.
- Defining `@keyframes` animations to create rotating effects.
- Applying transform `rotate` and `transform-origin` properties to alter the rotation point of elements.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_8
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/day_8
