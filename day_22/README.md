## Project Structure

The project includes:

- `index.html` - Contains the structure of the dashboard with SVG circles for progress indication.
- `style.css` - Provides the styling and animations for the dashboard elements.

### HTML Structure

The HTML file consists of:

- A `container` div that holds the entire dashboard.
- A `center` div that centers the content.
- A `head-line` for the title and `circle-big` and `circles-small` classes for the large and small progress indicators.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file contains:

- Reset rules and centering styles for the body.
- Styling for the `container`, `head-line`, and the circular progress bars.
- Custom animations for the progress bars to visually indicate the progress from 0 to the current value.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the dashboard.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_21-30/day_22
