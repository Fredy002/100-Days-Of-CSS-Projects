## Overview

This project demonstrates:

- An interactive search bar with dynamic autocomplete suggestions.
- JavaScript event handling to toggle visibility and content based on user input.
- Stylish and responsive design for a seamless user experience.

## HTML Structure

- The `container` div wraps around a `center` div.
- Inside the `center`, there's a `table` div for the search input and search icon, and a `section` for autocomplete suggestions.
- Autocomplete suggestions are styled as links (`<a>`) for user interactivity.

## JavaScript Functionality

- Listens for user input in the search bar (`#search`).
- Toggles the visibility of the autocomplete suggestions based on input length.
- Dynamically updates the content of the autocomplete suggestions based on the user's input.

## CSS Details

- The `.container` class sets the dimensions, background color, and box-shadow for a sleek appearance.
- The `.center` class positions the search bar and autocomplete suggestions centrally.
- Input styling ensures a modern look with a focus on usability.

## Interactive Elements

- The search bar responds to user typing, revealing suggestions.
- Autocomplete suggestions dynamically update as the user types.
- Hover effects on suggestions enhance user interactivity.

## How to Use

To interact with the search bar:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Start typing in the search bar to see autocomplete suggestions.
3. Hover over and click on suggestions for further interaction.
