## Overview

- This project demonstrates an animated alert box that provides a user-friendly way to display messages such as errors or warnings.
- The alert box features a dismiss button, allowing users to interactively close the message.

## HTML Structure

- The `.container` class encloses the entire alert box component.
- Within, the `.alert` div encompasses the alert content, including an image, title, message, and dismiss button.

## CSS Details

- The `.container` sets the general layout and styling of the alert area.
- `.alert` handles the design of the alert box, including background, dimensions, and typography.
- Animations (`show-alert` and `hide-alert`) are used to create a dynamic appearance and disappearance of the alert box.
- The `.buttom` class provides styling for the dismiss button, with a hover effect for improved user interaction.

## JavaScript Functionality

- JavaScript is used to toggle the `hide` class on the alert box, controlling its visibility in response to the button click.

## How to Use

1. Add the HTML structure to your page where you want the alert to appear.
2. Link the provided CSS for styling.
3. Include the JavaScript to ensure interactive dismissal of the alert.
4. Customize the message, title, and image according to your requirements.
