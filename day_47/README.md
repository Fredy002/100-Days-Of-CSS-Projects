## Overview

- This creation features a 20x20 grid, each cell being an interactive pixel.
- Users can click on each pixel to change its color, allowing for creative expression and design.

## HTML Structure

- The main element is the `.container` class, containing 400 `.pixel` divs.
- Each `.pixel` div includes a checkbox input and a label, allowing for interactivity.

## CSS Details

- The `.container` is styled with a grid layout to form the 20x20 matrix.
- The `.tab` class represents each pixel, styled to change color upon interaction.

## Interaction and User Experience

- Hovering over a pixel highlights it, enhancing the interactive experience.

## Implementation Guide
