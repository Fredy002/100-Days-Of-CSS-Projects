## Overview

This project features:

- A pulsating circle centered within a container.
- A dynamic line animation created using SVG.
- CSS keyframe animations for smooth and continuous motion.

## HTML Structure

- A `container` div that sets the stage for the animation.
- Inside the container, a `circle` div for the pulsating circle.
- An `svg` element with a `path` defines the animated line.

## CSS Details

- The `.container` class establishes the dimensions and styling of the animation's stage.
- The `.circle` class defines the size, position, and border properties of the pulsating circle.
- The `.line` class applies to the SVG path, specifying stroke properties and the animation.

## Animations

- The `@keyframes line` animation creates a moving effect for the SVG line.
- The `@keyframes circle` animation controls the pulsating effect of the circle.

## Usage Instructions

To experience the animation:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Observe the continuous animation of the circle and line within the container.
