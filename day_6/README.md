## Project Structure

This project consists of two primary files:

- `index.html` for the HTML structure.
- `style.css` for styling.

### HTML Structure

The HTML structure is composed of a main container div that houses two primary sections: the left section and the right section. The left section contains user information like a photo, name, and action links for following or messaging the user. The right section displays user statistics like the number of posts, likes, and followers.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file contains styles for positioning, coloring, and styling various elements on the page. Some of the key features include:

- A linear background gradient for the body.
- Usage of `grid` and `flexbox` for layout control.
- Custom hover animations for interactive elements.
- Border styling to create a unique design around the user's photo.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_6
