# Day 36: Interactive Tabs with Icons

On Day 36 of the 100 Days of CSS Challenge, we explore creating an interactive tabbed interface using HTML, CSS, and Material Icons. This example demonstrates how to use radio buttons for tab selection and CSS for styling and animations.

## Overview

- The project showcases a tabbed interface with a clean and modern design.
- It uses Material Design icons for tab labels, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.
- The tabs are interactive, allowing users to switch between different content areas.

## HTML Structure

- The main container holds the entire tabbed interface.
- Each tab is represented by a radio input and a label containing an icon.
- The content for each tab is placed in separate divs within a `content` container.

## CSS Details

- The `.container` class sets the size and style for the outer container.
- The `.tab` class styles each tab, including hover effects and active state styling.
- The `.content` and `.box` classes control the layout and visibility of the tab content.

## Interactivity Mechanics

- Radio buttons (`input[type="radio"]`) are used to manage tab selection.
- CSS selectors (`:checked`) change the appearance of a tab when it is selected.
- Transition effects smooth the switching of tab content.

## How to Use

1. Include the HTML and CSS in your project.
2. Customize the icons and content for each tab as per your requirements.
3. Utilize this component in dashboards, settings panels, or any interface requiring tabbed navigation.

## Cloning the Project

You can clone and run the project using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_31-40/day_36
cd 100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects
open index.html
```

## Learning Outcomes

- Change the color scheme to match your brand or design.
- Use different icons or add text labels alongside icons for clearer navigation.
- Experiment with the animation speeds or effects for switching tab content.
