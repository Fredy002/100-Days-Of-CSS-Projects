# Day 12: 100 Days of CSS Projects

On Day 12 of the 100 Days of CSS Challenge, we delve into a quote card showcasing a beautiful design alongside a functionality that provides a definition for a highlighted word. This project demonstrates how CSS and HTML can be used to create interactive and informative designs.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two primary files:

- `index.html` for the HTML structure.
- `style.css` for styling.

### HTML Structure

The HTML document is structured around a `container` div that encloses a `quote` div. Within the `quote` div, there's a paragraph (`<p>`) element containing the quote, and a paragraph element for the author. A special highlight is given to the word "obsession" which when hovered, reveals a pop-up with its pronunciation and definition.

### CSS Styling

The styling of the project makes extensive use of positioning, transitions, and hover effects to create a visually appealing and interactive experience. Here are some key points:

- Utilizing `position: relative` and `position: absolute` to precisely position elements.
- Styling the `info` div to appear as a pop-up with `visibility`, `opacity`, `clip-path`, and `transition` properties.
- Implementing a hover effect on the `.focus` class to reveal the pop-up.
- Utilizing a web font for material symbols to represent a volume icon.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredy002/100-Days-Of-CSS-Projects/tree/day_11-20/day_12
